				<p class="mb-5">
My name is Timo, and I write about technology, health, and the space where both quietly shape our lives.				</p>
				<p class="mb-5">
I am a data engineer by profession and a curious builder by nature. For many years, technology was mainly about progress, efficiency, and solving complex problems. I worked in data and analytics, explored cloud systems, and enjoyed turning abstract ideas into working software. Creating things has always been my way of understanding the world.				</p>
<p class="mb-5">
	In 2021, my life changed when I became severely ill with ME/CFS. Suddenly, the fast paced world I was used to no longer applied. Energy became limited, plans fragile, and certainty rare. This experience forced me to slow down and rethink not only how I live, but what truly matters.
</p>				
<p class="mb-5">
Living with a chronic and largely invisible illness has deeply changed my perspective. It has made me more attentive to quiet struggles, more critical of how we treat health and productivity, and more aware of the gaps in our healthcare systems. Over time, this led me to become a health advocate, speaking up for patient experiences that are often overlooked or misunderstood.				</p>
				<p class="mb-5">
This blog is a space where all of that comes together. I write about technology I explore, projects I work on when energy allows, and thoughts shaped by illness, recovery, and resilience. Sometimes the topics are technical, sometimes personal, often both.
